# toodoo app

* Live demo: http://toodooapp.herokuapp.com
* Main purpose of this was to try out React on the client side with the minimal use of Sinatra on the server side.
* Basically a copy of TodoMVC's [React example][TodoMVC] PLUS ajax requests sent to and received from the server MINUS the editing feature.
